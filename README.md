## 🔍 Overview

This project is a continuation of my midterm NewsBot submission, expanded into a full production-ready NLP system. NewsBot 2.0 is designed to analyze real-world news articles using classification, topic modeling, and sentiment detection.

I built two models inside Jupyter notebooks, then integrated both into web apps using Flask. Users can predict the category of a news headline or analyze the tone and main topic of a story in real-time.
